A recent speech from Sequoia Capital, **"The $10 Trillion AI Revolution,"** argues we're in a "Cognitive Revolution" that will reshape the global economy. It's a powerful thesis.

### Key Insights in Brief

1.  **From Certainty to Leverage:** The core shift is from writing rigid, rule-based software (**certainty**) to building goal-oriented AI agents that figure out *how* to solve problems (**leverage**). This allows one person to accomplish the work of many.

2.  **FLOPs per Knowledge Worker:** A new metric to measure production. Just as the Industrial Revolution used horsepower, the Cognitive Revolution will be measured by the computational power available to each worker.

3.  **Real-World Validation:** Tangible results and value creation are becoming more important than abstract academic benchmarks for measuring AI's success.

### From Theory to Code: The Cognitive Leverage Engine

To translate these concepts into a hands-on experience, I'm building the **Cognitive Leverage Engine**.

**[Explore the Project on GitHub: https://github.com/zhu-weijie/cognitive-leverage-engine](https://github.com/zhu-weijie/cognitive-leverage-engine)**

This project is a practical lab where you can:
*   Simulate the "FLOPs per knowledge worker" metric with an interactive API.
*   Explore the difference between "certainty" and "leverage" agent architectures.
*   Experiment with forward-looking AI themes like persistent memory and voice interfaces.

The best way to understand the future is to build it.
