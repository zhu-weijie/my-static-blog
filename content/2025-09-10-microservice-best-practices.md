### 1. Separate Data Store
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Microservice Architecture
        ServiceA[Service A] --> DB_A[(Database A)]
        ServiceB[Service B] --> DB_B[(Database B)]
    end

    style ServiceA fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style ServiceB fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### 2. Keep Code at a Similar Level of Maturity
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Code Maturity
        ServiceA[Service A] --- Level3[Level 3]
        ServiceB[Service B] --- Level4[Level 4]
        ServiceC[Service C] --- Level3_2[Level 3]
    end

    style ServiceA fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style ServiceB fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style ServiceC fill:#bfa,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### 3. Separate Build for Each Microservice
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Independent Builds
        ServiceA[Service A] --> BuildA{Build & Test A} --> DeployA((Deploy A))
        ServiceB[Service B] --> BuildB{Build & Test B} --> DeployB((Deploy B))
        ServiceC[Service C] --> BuildC{Build & Test C} --> DeployC((Deploy C))
    end
```

### 4. Single Responsibility Principle
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Single Responsibility
        A[Monolithic Application] --> B(User Management)
        A --> C(Order Processing)
        A --> D(Payment Gateway)
        A --> E(Notification Service)
    end

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### 5. Deploy into Containers
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Containerization
        ServiceA[Service A] ==> ContainerA[fa:fa-box Container A]
        ServiceB[Service B] ==> ContainerB[fa:fa-box Container B]
        ServiceC[Service C] ==> ContainerC[fa:fa-box Container C]
    end
```

### 6. Treat Servers as Stateless
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant StatelessService as Service

    Client->>StatelessService: Request (req)
    activate StatelessService
    StatelessService-->>Client: Response (resp)
    deactivate StatelessService
```

### 7. Domain-Driven Design
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Domain-Driven Design Layers"
        subgraph "Infrastructure Layer"
            direction LR
            UI(UI)
            DB(Database)
            API(API)
        end
        subgraph "Application Layer"
            AppServices(App Services)
        end
        subgraph "Domain Layer (Core)"
            Entities(Entities, Aggregates)
        end
    end

    UI --> AppServices
    API --> AppServices
    AppServices --> Entities
    AppServices --> DB
```

### 8. Micro Frontend Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Micro Frontend"
        PaymentsF[Payments Frontend] --> Gateway{API Gateway}
        OrdersF[Orders Frontend] --> Gateway

        Gateway --> PaymentsS[Payments Service]
        Gateway --> OrdersS[Orders Service]
    end
```

### 9. Orchestrating Microservices
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Microservice Orchestration"
        API --> K8s[Kubernetes Master]
        UI --> K8s
        CLI --> K8s

        K8s --> Node1(Node 1)
        K8s --> Node2(Node 2)
        K8s --> Node3(Node 3)
    end
```
