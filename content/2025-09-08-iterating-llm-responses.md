    B --> C["First Pass Analysis<br/>- Scans the information environment<br/>- Summarizes conflicting popular claims (e.g., social media posts)<br/>- May seem 'wrong' or incomplete"];

    D --> F[Iterate with a 'Sorting Prompt'<br/>e.g., 'What is the evidence for and against?'];
    F --> G["Second Pass Analysis<br/>- The LLM is forced to dig deeper<br/>- Compares sources & weighs evidence<br/>- Distinguishes between claims and facts"];
    G --> H["Accurate, Reasoned Conclusion<br/>- Identifies the most credible information<br/>- Explains why initial claims were likely incorrect"];
